# SypherCore Blockchain

SypherCore is the next-generation blockchain platform offering complete privacy, quantum resistance, and advanced scalability. Built for true decentralization, SypherCore enables hidden transactions, privacy-preserving smart contracts, and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) rewards.

## Key Features:
- **Zero-Knowledge SNARKs**: Enabling fully private transactions and contracts.
- **Quantum Resistance**: Protecting against future quantum computing threats.
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: Rewards for validators securing the network.
- **Hidden Transactions**: Full anonymity using zk-SNARKs and ring signatures.
- **Privacy Smart Contracts**: Fully secure and hidden logic for dApps.
